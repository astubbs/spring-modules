  <title>Java Content Repository (JSR-170)</title>

  <sect1>
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>JSR-170 defines "a standard, implementation independent, way to
    access content bi-directionally on a granular level within a content
    repository. A Content Repository is a high-level information management
    system that is a superset of traditional data repositories. A content
    repository implements "content services" such as: author based versioning,
    full textual searching, fine grained access control, content
    categorization and content event monitoring. It is these "content
    services" that differentiate a Content Repository from a Data Repository."
    (taken from the JSR-170 description page).</para>

    <para>More information about Java Content Repository (from here on refered
    as JCR) can be found at <ulink
    url="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=170">here</ulink>.</para>

    <para>The package has been designed to resemble as much as possible the
    ORM packages from the main Spring distribution. Users familiar with these
    can start using the JCR-support right away without much hassle; the
    documentation resembles the main documentation structure also. For those
    who haven't used them, please refer to the main Spring documentation,
    mainly <ulink
    url="http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/1.2.x/reference/orm.html">chapter
    12 (Data Access using O/R Mappers)</ulink> as the current documentation
    focuses on the JCR specific details, the Spring infrastructure being
    outside the scope of this document. As the ORM package, the main reason
    for the JCR support is to ease development using Spring unchecked
    DAOexception hierarchy, integrated transaction management, ease of
    testing.</para>

    <para>Before going any further I would like to thank Guillaume Bort
    &lt;guillaume.bort@zenexity.fr&gt; and Brian Moseley
    &lt;bcm@osafoundation.org&gt; which worked on some implementation of their
    own and were kind enough to provide their code and ideas when I started
    working on this package.</para>

    <title>JSR standard support</title>

    <para>The standard support works only with the JSR-170 API (represented by
    javax.jcr package) without making any use of specific features of the
    implementations (which we will discuss later).</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>SessionFactory</title>

      <para>JSR-170 doesn't provide a notion of SessionFactory but rather a
      repository which based on the credentials and workspace provided
      returnes a session. The SessionFactory interface describes a basic
      contract for retrieving session without any knowledge of credentials,
      it's implementation acting as a wrapper around the
      javax.jcr.Repository:<programlisting>&lt;bean id="sessionFactory" class="org.springmodules.jcr.JcrSessionFactory"&gt;
 &lt;property name="repository" ref="repository"/&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;</programlisting>The only requirement for creating a
      sessionFactory is the repository (which will be discussed later). There
      are cases were credentials have to be submitted. One problem that new
      users have is that javax.jcr.SimpleCredentials requires a char array
      (char[]) as constructor parameter and not a String and the current
      Spring distribution (1.2.5) does not contains a PropertyEditor for char
      arrays. The following examples (taken from the sample) shows how we can
      use String statical methods to obtain a char array:<programlisting>&lt;bean id="sessionFactory" class="org.springmodules.jcr.JcrSessionFactory"&gt;
  &lt;property name="repository" ref="repository"/&gt;
  &lt;property name="credentials"&gt;
   &lt;bean class="javax.jcr.SimpleCredentials"&gt;
    &lt;constructor-arg index="0" value="bogus"/&gt;
    &lt;!-- create the credentials using a bean factory --&gt;
    &lt;constructor-arg index="1"&gt;
     &lt;bean factory-bean="password"
          factory-method="toCharArray"/&gt;
    &lt;/constructor-arg&gt;
   &lt;/bean&gt;
  &lt;/property&gt;
  &lt;property&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;

&lt;!-- create the password to return it as a char[] --&gt;
&lt;bean id="password" class="java.lang.String"&gt;
  &lt;constructor-arg index="0" value="pass"/&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;</programlisting>Using the static toCharArray (from
      java.lang.String) we transformed the String supplied as password (with
      value 'pass') to SimpleCredentials for user 'bogus'. Note that
      JcrSessionFactory can also register namespaces, add listeners and has
      utility methods for determing the underlying repository properties - see
      the javadoc and the samples for more information.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Inversion of Control: JcrTemplate and JcrCallback</title>

      <para>Most of the work with the JCR will be made through the JcrTemplate
      itself or through a JcrCallback. The template requires a SessionFactory
      and can be configured to create sessions on demand or reuse them
      (thread-bound) - the default behavior.<programlisting>&lt;bean id="jcrTemplate" class="org.springmodules.jcr.JcrTemplate"&gt;
  &lt;property name="sessionFactory" ref="sessionFactory"/&gt;
  &lt;property name="allowCreate" value="true"/&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;</programlisting>JcrTemplate contains many of the operations
      defined in javax.jcr.Session and javax.jcr.query.Query classes plus some
      convenient ones; however there are cases when they are not enought. With
      JcrCallback, one can work directly with the Session, the callback begin
      thread-safe, opens/closes sessions and deals with
      exceptions:<programlisting>    public void saveSmth() {
        template.execute(new JcrCallback() {

            public Object doInJcr(Session session) throws RepositoryException {
                Node root = session.getRootNode();
                log.info("starting from root node " + root);
                Node sample = root.addNode("sample node");
                sample.setProperty("sample property", "bla bla");
                log.info("saved property " + sample);
                session.save();
                return null;
            }
        });
    } </programlisting></para>

      <sect3>
        <title>Implementing Spring-based DAOs without callbacks</title>

        <para>The developer can access the repository in a more 'traditional'
        way without using JcrTemplate (and JcrCallback) but still use Spring
        DAO exception hierarchy. SpringModules JcrDaoSupport offers base
        methods for retrieving Session from the SessionFactory (in a
        transaction-aware manner is transactions are supported) and for
        converting exceptions (which use SessionFactoryUtils static methods).
        Note that such code will usually pass "false" into getSession's the
        "allowCreate" flag, to enforce running within a transaction (which
        avoids the need to close the returned Session, as it its lifecycle is
        managed by the transaction):</para>

        <para><programlisting>public class ProductDaoImpl extends JcrDaoSupport {

    public void saveSmth()
            throws DataAccessException, MyException {

        Session session = getSession(getSessionFactory(), false);
        try {
                Node root = session.getRootNode();
                log.info("starting from root node " + root);
                Node sample = root.addNode("sample node");
                sample.setProperty("sample property", "bla bla");
                log.info("saved property " + sample);
                session.save();
                return null;
        }
        catch (RepositoryException ex) {
            throw convertJCRAccessException(ex);
        }
    }
}</programlisting>The major advantage of such direct JCR access code is that
        it allows any checked application exception to be thrown within the
        data access code, while JcrTemplate is restricted to unchecked
        exceptions within the callback. Note that one can often defer the
        corresponding checks and the throwing of application exceptions to
        after the callback, which still allows working with JcrTemplate. In
        general, JcrTemplate's convenience methods are simpler and more
        convenient for many scenarios.</para>

      <title>RepositoryFactoryBean</title>

      <para>Repository configuration have not been discussed by JSR-170 and
      every implementation has a different approach. The JCR-support provides
      an abstract repository factory bean which defined the main functionality
      leaving subclasses to deal only with the configuration issues. The
      current version supports jackrabbit and jeceira as repository
      implementations but adding new ones is very easy. Note that through
      Spring, one can configure a repository without the mentioned
      RepositoryFactoryBean.</para>

  <sect1>
    <title>Extensions support</title>

    <para>JSR-170 defines 2 levels of complains and a number of optional
    features which can be provided by implementations transactions being
    one.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>JackRabbit</title>

      <para><ulink
      url="http://incubator.apache.org/jackrabbit/">JackRabbit</ulink> is the
      default implementation of the JSR-170 and it's part of the Apache
      Foundation. Even though at the time of writing it's still part of the
      incubator, there are plans for releasing 1.0 in the near future.
      JackRabbit support both levels and all the optional features described
      in the specifications. <programlisting>&lt;bean id="repository" class="org.springmodules.jcr.jackrabbit.RepositoryFactoryBean"&gt;
  &lt;!-- normal factory beans params --&gt;
  &lt;property name="configuration" value="classpath:jackrabbit-repo.xml"/&gt;
  &lt;property name="homeDir" value="/repo"/&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;</programlisting>Note that RepositoryFactoryBean makes use of
      Spring Resource to find the configuration file.</para>

      <sect3>
        <title>Transaction Management</title>

        <para>One of the nicest features of the JCR support in Spring modules
        is transaction management (find out more about Spring transaction
        management in <ulink
        url="http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/1.2.x/reference/transaction.html">Chapter
        8</ulink> of the Spring official reference documentation. At the
        moment it's possible to use a LocalTransactionManager or use the JCA
        connector from JackRabbit to enlist the repository in a XA transaction
        through a JTA transaction manager. As a side note the JCA scenario can
        be used within an application server along with a specific descriptor
        or using a portable JCA connector (like <ulink
        url="http://www.jencks.org">Jencks</ulink>) which can work outside or
        inside an application server.</para>

        <sect4>
          <title>LocalTransactionManager</title>

          <para>For local transaction the LocalTransactionManager should be
          used:<programlisting>&lt;bean id="jcrTransactionManager"
 class="org.springmodules.jcr.jackrabbit.LocalTransactionManager"&gt;
   &lt;property name="sessionFactory" ref="jcrSessionFactory"/&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;</programlisting>for which only the session factory is required.
          As JackRabbit exposes a XA Resource the LocalTransactionManager
          creates a UserTransaction behinds the scenes and uses that for
          commiting/rolling back the changes.</para>

          <para>and has to be set inside the application context or the
          default one (non trasactional aware one) will be used.
          Unfortunatelly implementation that support transactions don't have a
          standard way of exposing them - that's why this requirement.
          Basically all you have to do is configure the JcrTemplate for
          example like this:<programlisting>&lt;bean id="jcrTemplate" class="org.springmodules.jcr.JcrTemplate"&gt;
  &lt;property name="sessionFactory" ref="sessionFactory"/&gt;
  &lt;property name="providerManager" ref="providerManager"/&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;</programlisting>Note that when using transactions in most cases
          you want to reuse the session (which means allowCreate property on
          jcrTemplate should be false (default)).</para>

        <sect4>
          <title>SessionHolderProviderManager and
          SessionHolderProvider</title>

          <para>Because JSR-170 doesn't directly address transaction, details
          vary from repository to repository and results in various
          SessionHolderProvider implementations (this class is used internally
          by the JCR support classes (JcrAccessor subclasses, JcrInterceptor,
          OpenSessionInViewFilter/Interceptor). JCR support contains (quite a
          lot of) classes to make this issue as painful as possible.
          SessionHolderProviderManager acts as a registry of
          SessionHolderProviders for different repositories and has several
          implementations that return user defined provider or discover them
          automatically.</para>

          <para>ServiceSessionHolderProvider is suitable for most of the
          cases. It uses <ulink
          url="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/guide/jar/jar.html#Service%20Provider">JDK
          1.3+ Service Provider specification</ulink> (also known as
          META-INF/services) for determining the holder provider. The class
          looks on the classpath under META-INF/services for the file named
          "org.springmodules.jcr.SessionHolderProvider" (which contains the
          full qualified name of a SessionHolderProvider implementation). The
          providers found are instantiated and registered and later on used
          for the repository they support. Using the
          ServiceSessionHolderProvider is straight forward:<programlisting>&lt;bean id="providerManager" class="org.springmodules.jcr.support.ServiceSessionHolderProviderManager"/&gt;</programlisting></para>

        <sect4>
          <title>JTA transactions</title>

          <para>For distributed transactions, using JCA is recommend in
          JackRabbit's case. An example is found inside the sample. You are
          free to use your application server JCA support; Jencks is used only
          for demonstrative purpose, the code inside the jackrabbit support
          having no dependency on it.</para>

  <sect1>
    <title>Mapping support</title>

    <para>Working with the JCR resembles to some degree to working with JDBC.
    Mapping support for the JCR seems to be the next logical step but the
    software market doesn't seem to offer any mature solution. The current
    package offers support for <ulink
    url="http://incubator.apache.org/graffito/project-structure.html">jcr-mapping</ulink>which
    is part of <ulink url="http://incubator.apache.org/graffito/">Graffito
    project</ulink> which belongs to the Apache foundation. However, Graffito
    itself is still in the incubator and the jcr-mapping is described as a
    prototype. The current support provides some base functionality taken from
    a snapshot which can be found inside the distribtution which most probably
    is old. However as jcr-mapping is clearly in alpha stage and a work in
    progress, users should not invest too much in this area but are encouraged
    to experiment and provide feedback. The current support contains a
    JcrMappingCallback and Template plus a FactoryBean for creating
    MappingDescriptors (which allows using more then one mapping file which is
    not possible at the moment in the jcr-mapping project).</para>
