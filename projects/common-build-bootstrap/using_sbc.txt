Spring Modules uses Spring common build (SCB) for its infrastructure. For a newly checked out project, one must download
the SCB from the CVS and add Spring Modules specific extensions. 

1. Download Spring Common Build

The ant script inside this directory does this already for you.
Note that at the moment it uses CVS and the cvs command is required. Under windows the cvs.exe is downloaded automatically, for
Linux there is no specific solution. If you have problems or the automatic procedure doesn't work for you, checkout spring common build and place it under projects/ folder (i.e. you'll end up with projects/common-build aka $SCB_HOME).

2. Apply Spring Modules modifications

just run the common-build.mod target. It will copy the required files to SCB folder and modify the necessary files.

3. Download the documentation libraries

if you want to generate the documentation files then you will need the DocBook libraries and styles. Run the "download-doc-lib" which
will download the zip and extract it into the required folder.

4. Starting a new project

When converting or starting a new project, you'll need to follow the SCB structure. You can find project templates inside $SCB_HOME/templates/projects, in most cases the basic one will suffice.

5. Documentation template

You can find the documentation template in common-build-bootstrap/template. Copy the folder structure into your module folder.
Once you have created the documentation xml, modify the index.xml to include it and put your name in the authors.xml file.
Make sure you include doc-targets.xml in your build.xml file:

    <import file="${common.build.dir}/doc-targets.xml" />
    
To generate the documentation, run ant doc-all. Use ant -p to find the other doc specific targets.
